            <span><b>About Delay The Opening</b> <br><br>The opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) has been delayed
            and is now scheduled for the final quarter of 2025. This delay is primarily due to 
            escalating regional instability and security concerns, specifically the ongoing conflict across the region.
            The postponement aims to ensure the museum's grand opening receives the international 
            attention and atmosphere it deserves, reflecting Egypt's cultural and historical significance.</span>
